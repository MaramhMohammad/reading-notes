# Learning Markdown

### First, I want to tell you What is **GitHub generally**, and what is it mainly used for? 

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is like a Backup, itâ€™s an online place where you can store your code, basically we use it to: 
* Version tracking
* Reviewing changes 
* Keep the changes separate until you want to add them


# So, What is The Markdown? :thinking:

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. it's a plain text-to-HTML conversion tool for content creators. It allows you to quickly design easy-to-read, easy-to-write content for the web, and have it magically converted to clean, structured HTML. 

### Let me give you an examples 

1. Syntax highlighting

**for Headers** 

(#) This is an h1 tag

(##)This is an h2 tag

(######) This is an h6 tag

 **for Lists** 
 
Unordered by adding astricsk 

Ordered by adding numbers 


and here is an example in adding links 

basicly we add a content in [] then without spaces we add url in ()
