# Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions!

There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* rgb values 
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

* hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

* color names
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page).

It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
