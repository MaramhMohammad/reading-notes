#  Programming with JavaScript 
JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier. 

Learning to program with JavaScript involves: 
- Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them
- Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
- Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today


# A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS 
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:

- RECIPES
- HANDBOOKS
- MANUALS

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the  tasks that need to be completed in  order to achieve it

# Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.  
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in  a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 
Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
and JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

# Functions 
Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce: 
- FUNCTIONS METHODS 
- OBJECTS 
- BUILT-IN OBJECTS

Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
